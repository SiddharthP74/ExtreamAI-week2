# ExtreamAI-week2

These are “working examples,” meaning:
✅ Each persona has 2–3 realistic sample prompts
✅ Each has AI-style responses that look operationally correct
✅ You can copy these directly and even test them in an AI orchestration flow (e.g., n8n, LangChain, or OpenDevin setup)

For orchestration flow i have used n8n a workflow automation tool — like an open-source version of Zapier or Node-RED.

n8n can be used to :

Chain together scripts (e.g., Python, bash, or Node.js)
Pull data from APIs (like VirusTotal, Shodan, etc.)
Send alerts to Slack/Telegram/Email
Orchestrate cybersecurity tasks (e.g., scanning → analyzing → reporting)
